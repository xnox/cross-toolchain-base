Architecture: all
Section: libs
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Embedded GNU C Library: Shared libraries (for cross-compiling)
 This package was generated by dpkg-cross for cross compiling.
 .
 Contains the standard libraries that are used by nearly all programs on
 the system. This package includes shared versions of the standard C library
 and the standard math library, as well as many others.

Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Section: debug
Description: Embedded GNU C Library: detached debugging symbols (for cross-compiling)
 This package was generated by dpkg-cross for cross compiling.
 .
 This package contains the detached debugging symbols for the GNU C
 library.

Description: Embedded GNU C Library: Development Libraries and Header Files (for cross-compiling)
 This package was generated by dpkg-cross for cross compiling.
 .
 Contains the symlinks, headers, and object files needed to compile
 and link programs which use the standard C library.

#Description: GCC support library
# Shared version of the support library, a library of internal subroutines
# that GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or
# special needs for some languages.
# .
# This package contains files for CROSS_ARCH architecture, for use in cross-compile
# environment.

Package: linux-libc-dev-CROSS_ARCH-cross
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Provides: linux-kernel-headers-CROSS_ARCH-cross, linux-libc-dev-CROSS_ARCH-dcv1
Description: Linux Kernel Headers for development (for cross-compiling)
 This package was generated by dpkg-cross for cross compiling.
 .
 This package provides headers from the Linux kernel.  These headers
 are used by the installed headers for GNU glibc and other system
 libraries. They are NOT meant to be used to build third-party modules for
 your kernel. Use linux-headers-* packages for that.
